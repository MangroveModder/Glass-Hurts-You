# Glass Hurts You

> This mod was made by Mangrove Modder.

It will let you break glass but cause damage to your player. This makes the game more realistic as glass breaks into sharp shards that cause people to bleed in real life. This mod would be good for players who want a more realistic experience in Minecraft.
